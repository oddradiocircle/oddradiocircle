Hey there! üëã
I'm Daniel, a technology lawyer who fell in love with coding while working on intellectual property cases. I studied `Law` but found myself increasingly drawn to `Software Development` and the fascinating intersection of technology and society.

I bridge the gap between legal practice and technology, focusing on developing open-source tools that make legal services more accessible and interactive. My work combines intellectual property expertise with programming, primarily using Python and JavaScript to create solutions that enhance how lawyers and clients interact with legal information.

As CEO of marca.global, I spend my days working on intellectual property and technology law while developing tools that improve legal work efficiency. I'm deeply passionate about free software, digital rights, and the complex relationship between technology and governance.

I'm particularly fascinated by human-machine interfaces in legal contexts and constantly explore ways to make legal information more accessible and interactive. When not coding or practicing law, you'll find me diving deep into geopolitics, technology policy, and their impact on society.

### üöÄ Current Focus
Currently focused on expanding legal tech tools, teaching AI & Law, and researching innovative approaches to legal service delivery through technology. My goal is to contribute to a more accessible and technologically empowered legal ecosystem.
